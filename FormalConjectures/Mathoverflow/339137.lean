Why do polynomials with coefficients 0,1
 like to have only factors with 0,1
 coefficients?

The predicate that all coefficients of a polynomial are either zero or one.

def IsZeroOne (P : ℝ[X]) := P.coeffs ⊆ {0, 1}

-- TODO(lezeau): add probabilistic reformulation and statement
-- that coefficients must at least lie in `[0, 1]`

Let $P(x), Q(x) ∈ ℝ[x]$ be two monic polynomials with non-negative coefficients.
If $R(x) = P(x)Q(x)$ is a $0,1$ polynomial (coefficients only from $\{0,1\}$), then $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$
are also $0, 1$ polynomials.
